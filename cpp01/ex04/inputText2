What's the difference between the heap and the stack ?

Originally, heaps and stacks are abstract data types :
these are rules and constraints which describes a data type,
in opposite to an implementation which define it.

When they are precede with the article "the", the stack describes the call stack,
a place where are store all function calls and local variables of a C-like
programming language program. In these circumstances, the "heap" is a reference
to dynamic allocation, because the implementation of malloc in standard lib is
heap oriented, meaning that memory is organized in a heap.
